Completed the SwiftUI tutorial, creating and combining views, building lists and navigation, and handling basic user inputs.
I followed the Apple Developer's course which can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui).

#### creating and combining views
The first module explains how to navigate the Xcode interface, and organizing files in the project navigator. 

###### Core Concepts:
- The `@main` attribute identifies the app’s entry point.
- The structure’s `body` property returns one or more scenes, which in turn provide content for display.
- An app that uses the SwiftUI app life cycle has a structure that conforms to the `App` protocol.
- You can use any combination of editors: the source editor, the canvas, or the inspectors.

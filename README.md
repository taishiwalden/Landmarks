Completed the SwiftUI tutorial, creating and combining views, building lists and navigation, and handling basic user inputs.
I followed the Apple Developer's course which can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui).

### Glance at the final product

#### creating and combining views
The first module explains how to navigate the Xcode interface, and organizing files in the project navigator. 

###### Core Concepts:
- The `@main` attribute identifies the app’s entry point.
- The structure’s `body` property returns one or more scenes, which in turn provide content for display.
- An app that uses the SwiftUI app life cycle has a structure that conforms to the `App` protocol.
- You can use any combination of editors: the source editor, the canvas, or the inspectors.

#### building lists and navigation

***
#### handling user inputs
This module explains how to customize list views using the `@State` attribute.

###### Core Concepts:
- The `@State` attribute is a value, or a set of values, that can change over time, and that affects a view’s behavior, content, or layout.
- Because you use state properties to hold information that’s specific to a view and its subviews, you always create state as `private`.
